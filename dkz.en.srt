Principles for Success. An
ultra-mini-series adventure in 30

1
00:00:04,945 --> 00:00:06,800
minutes and in 8 episodes.

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,620
Episode 1. The Call to Adventure.

3
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:16,395
Before we begin, let me just establish
the fact that I don't know much

4
00:00:16,445 --> 00:00:18,200
relative to what I need to know.

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,435
Whatever success I've had in
life has more to do with my

6
00:00:22,485 --> 00:00:25,820
knowing how to deal with my not
knowing than anything I know.

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,595
That I should be telling other
people what to do sounds kind

8
00:00:30,645 --> 00:00:31,940
of presumptuous to me.

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,795
But I'm going to do it because
I believe that the principles that

10
00:00:35,845 --> 00:00:38,940
have made me successful could help
others achieve their own goals.

11
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,775
I'm now at a stage in my own life
in which it is much more important

12
00:00:43,825 --> 00:00:48,555
to me to pass along what I've learned
about how to be successful than

13
00:00:48,605 --> 00:00:50,580
to seek more success for myself.

14
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,535
What you choose to do with
these principles is up to you.

15
00:00:54,585 --> 00:00:59,975
You have to be an independent thinker
because only you can develop your own

16
00:01:00,025 --> 00:01:01,900
principles based on your own values.

17
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,675
This brings me to my first and
most fundamental principle which

18
00:01:06,725 --> 00:01:11,100
is that you need to think for
yourself about what is true.

19
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,780
So let's get started.

20
00:01:13,221 --> 00:01:15,740
Early on I discovered
I needed principles.

21
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:19,905
Principles are smart ways for handling
things that happen over and over

22
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:21,255
again in similar situations.

23
00:01:21,305 --> 00:01:26,175
There are principles for everything
from skiing to parenting to

24
00:01:26,225 --> 00:01:27,740
cooking and so on.

25
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,715
I'm going to share some of
my most important overarching life

26
00:01:32,765 --> 00:01:36,320
principles that influence how we
approach everything that we do.

27
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,334
I didn't start out with principles.

28
00:01:40,384 --> 00:01:42,797
I acquired them over a
lifetime of experiences.

29
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:47,720
Mostly from making mistakes
and reflecting on them.

30
00:01:48,501 --> 00:01:51,680
My life principles are simple
but they're not complete.

31
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,975
I still struggle to make the best
decisions and I still make mistakes and

32
00:01:57,025 --> 00:01:58,760
learn new principles all the time.

33
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,160
This is the reality.

34
00:02:02,141 --> 00:02:07,135
At the beginning I needed to escape
the conventions that surrounded me which

35
00:02:07,185 --> 00:02:08,955
meant that I needed to think for myself.

36
00:02:09,005 --> 00:02:14,779
Unless you want to have a life that
is directed by others you need to

37
00:02:14,821 --> 00:02:17,060
decide for yourself what to do.

38
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,520
And you need to have
the courage to do it.

39
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,125
But I didn't know that at first.

40
00:02:23,175 --> 00:02:25,580
I only learned that from
going on my adventure.

41
00:02:26,321 --> 00:02:31,635
Looking back on my own journey I now see
that time is like a river that carries

42
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:36,320
us forward into encounters with reality
that require us to make decisions.

43
00:02:37,121 --> 00:02:41,820
We can't stop our movement down this
river and we can't avoid the encounters.

44
00:02:42,661 --> 00:02:45,640
We can only approach them
in the best possible way.

45
00:02:46,701 --> 00:02:49,798
In your lifetime you will
face millions of decisions.

46
00:02:50,401 --> 00:02:54,300
The quality of your decisions will
determine the quality of your life.

47
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,755
Over the course of my lifetime the
most valuable things I've learned were

48
00:02:58,805 --> 00:03:03,935
the results of mistakes I reflected
on to help form principles so I

49
00:03:03,985 --> 00:03:05,435
wouldn't make the same mistakes again.

50
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:10,095
These principles took me from being
a very ordinary middle class kid from

51
00:03:10,145 --> 00:03:14,640
Long Island to becoming very successful
as judged by conventional measures.

52
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:19,055
They also gave me the meaningful
work and meaningful relationships

53
00:03:19,105 --> 00:03:22,740
that I value even more than
these conventional successes.

54
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,440
People often ask me how I did it.

55
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,478
I can assure you it wasn't because
of my uniqueness as a person.

56
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,735
It was the result of a unique
approach to life I believe

57
00:03:32,785 --> 00:03:34,260
almost anybody can adopt.

58
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:38,939
It starts with embracing reality
and dealing with it.

59
00:03:39,721 --> 00:03:42,440
In episode two I'll explain
what that means.
